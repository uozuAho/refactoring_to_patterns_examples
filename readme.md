# Refactoring practice

Examples from "Refactoring to Patterns", in C#

- [book site](https://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/)
- [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85041.Refactoring_to_Patterns)

Each directory in this repo has a refactoring example, with at least two
subdirectories:
- initial_state: the initial state copied from the book
- refactored: the final state after performing the refactoring

To practice a refactoring, simply copy the initial_state directory and get
started!
