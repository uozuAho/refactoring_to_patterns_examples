# Move creation knowledge to factory

https://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/classesWithFactory.html


# Pros
+ reduce 'conceptual weight' by hiding classes clients don't need to know about
+ enforces 'program to an interface, not an implementation'

# Cons
- requires new/updated creation methods when new classes are created
